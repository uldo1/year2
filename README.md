# Getting Started

To run the server:

```shell
$ deno run --allow-all --unstable index.js
```

The website database has been added with a root password of `p455w0rd` and a single **accounts** table which is pre-configured with a single account:

username: `doej`

password: `p455w0rd`

There is a secure page called **Foo Bar** which can be accessed at the `/foo` route. You will need to delete this and replace with your own secure content.
